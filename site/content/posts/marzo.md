### Marzò are interested in technology that can improve their fledgling business.

#### The problem with quality control
Automating farm activities isn't always viable, and still relies on a hierarchy of farmhands.

Monitoring people's output is often met with resistance. So to improve precision harvesting and simplify the rules, algorithmic comparison provides a cost-effective way to monitor yeilds. By prototyping with OpenCV, the business is exploring the viability of automation and reaping the benefits.

#### Communicating family values
A warm, welcoming website appeals to food connoisseurs and locals looking for the best organic produce. This mobile‑first site uses powerful, responsive tools to generate nible pages.

For manageable styling: Tachyons adapts to marketing needs – without growing the underlying codebase. It works by compounding utility classes for each page element. Supplemental classes can easily be written to extend the defaults and works nicely with blazy for progressive image handling.

HUGO, a static site generator producing flat file inside NetlifyCMS. This puts content firmly in the hands of authors to produce rich, multilingual content – all without a bloated database layer.
